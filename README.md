App Functionality
=================

The page opens with a placeholder crime scene image. A Moonlight Madness Jumbotron announces the app title. On the left hand side there is a user menu with a drop down city selector and a query limiter. On the right hand side are images of four moon phases.

The user may select from one of the five cities listed and input a number between 1 and 100. If the number is not between that range or not a number, the user will get a prompt to reenter their number.

On clicking submit, the crime scene image will be replaced with a google map centered on the city of their choice. A number of bouncing thief images will appear depending on the number the user has input. These icons correlate to the locations of crime instances within the city listed. The user may click on each icon to see what type of crime was committed at that location. 

A table will populate below the map with information on each crime instance. This includes the day of the week, time of day, the temperature outside, and the weather conditions.

The user may then click on one of the four moon images to filter through which of the crimes occurred during that moon cycle.
